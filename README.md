- 👋 Hi, I’m @santiagopsanchez
- 👀 I’m interested in blending the technical side of IT meanwhile not losing focus on the main goal: creating value.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Sciente at Coder House, and in 5th and last year of my Bussines Administration Bechalors Degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interasting proyects, that are willing to improve the lives of people not only in my country, but in the entire world. And also to know poeple with intersating profiles, that would guide and lead me in my career.
- 📫 How to reach me: E-mail: santiagopsanchez0@gmail.com / LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-sanchez-9675681b9/
